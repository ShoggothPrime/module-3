          <p>Pizza — known to the whole world the national dish of Italy in the form of an open round cake covered with the classic recipe tomato and melted cheese (usually mozzarella). This beguiling culinary professional language called topping.
          Fried chicken is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates
            fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner, or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of fast food restaurants. French fries are generally salted and are often
            served with ketchup; in many countries they are topped instead with other condiments or toppings, including vinegar, mayonnaise, or other local specialties. Fries can also be topped more elaborately, as in the dishes of poutine and chili cheese
            fries. Sometimes, fries are made with sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, are baked instead of fried, or are cut into unusual shapes.Pizza — known to the whole world the national dish of Italy in the form of an open round cake covered with the classic recipe tomato and melted cheese (usually mozzarella).
